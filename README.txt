# AI-Based Resume Matching System

## Project Overview

The AI-Based Resume Screening and Job Matching System is an intelligent application that automatically matches candidate resumes with job descriptions using Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The system analyzes skills, experience, education, and keywords from resumes and compares them with job requirements to provide a matching score and ranking.

This project aims to reduce manual effort in recruitment and improve the accuracy and fairness of candidate shortlisting.

## Objectives

* Automate resume screening and job matching
* Reduce recruiter bias and manual workload
* Improve accuracy in candidate-job alignment
* Provide ranked resume recommendations based on relevance

---

## Key Features

* Resume text extraction (PDF/DOCX)
* Job description analysis
* Skill and keyword matching
* Similarity score generation
* Resume ranking based on match percentage
* Scalable and modular architecture

---

## Technologies Used

* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries & Frameworks:

  * Natural Language Processing: NLTK / spaCy
  * Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
  * Text Vectorization: TF-IDF / Cosine Similarity
* **Backend (Optional):** Flask / FastAPI
* **Database (Optional):** SQLite / MongoDB
* **Tools:** Git, GitHub

---

## System Workflow

1. User uploads resumes and job descriptions
2. Text is extracted and preprocessed
3. Important skills and keywords are identified
4. Text data is converted into numerical vectors
5. Similarity between resume and job description is calculated
6. Matching score is generated
7. Resumes are ranked based on relevance

---

## Matching Technique

* Text preprocessing (tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization)
* TF-IDF vectorization
* Cosine similarity computation
* Percentage-based match scoring
